so you want to know a little about me? im a software developer and id like to push my skills. my method for this is mostly just throwing myself in to the deep-end when it comes to development projects (learning by doing).

i think like many other developers, i have aside-project that i thought i could do this by myself, but i found that my side project has many branches of work so it is becoming increasingly difficult to keep this side-project organised... so i thought to myself:

> i think i need to place to organize my work.

and then i thought:

> a blog could be useful in many ways.
>
> 1. i could learn how to create a GatsbyJS blog.
> 2. its an excuse to this domain name thats been going to waste for the past few years.

so here is the idea:

an instant messaging platform, where you communicate with memes.
