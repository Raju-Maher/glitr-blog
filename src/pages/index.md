  title: Create all the memes!
  description: >-
    the goal of this project is to create something that will allow everyone (as
    many as i can) to create memes with minimum effort. internet memes (or
    simply just "memes" as they have become known) have become part of a normal
    experience on the internet. although i believe there is a still a lot of
    people that are unable to create memes themselves; whether it is because of
    a lack of technical know-how or the tools required are prohibitively
    complicated or expensive.... lets change that!
description: >-
  the plan is to create an easy-to-use meme editor mobile app that is available
  for free on as many platforms as possible.

  description: >
    Kaldi is the ultimate spot for coffee lovers who want to learn about their
    java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take coffee
    production, roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that
    knowledge to anyone. This is an edit via identity...

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
