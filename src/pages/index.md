  title: the problem with memes today
  description: >
    if internet memes could be described to be a branch of linguistics, it would
    be by far the most univesal language in the world. internet memes are able
    to express ideas, concepts, meaning, emotion, ...(the list goes on).
    internet memes also have the ability to to address an incredibly wide
    demographic. due to its nature in being made of simple templates and rules,
    it makes internet memes easy to understand regardless of an individuals
    background.


    it is unfortunate that there not not many tools available for creating memes
    for the masses. while memes are typically simple by their nature in
    expressing simple ideas or concepts, i still think that the ability to
    communicate in memes is still prohibitively difficult. people do not want to
    invest time into learning to to use complex image editing software to create
    a simple meme.
description: >-
  the plan is to create some kind of easy to use meme editor, and create some
  king of social network around using memes to communicate.

  the project will be made of up many parts and im hoping to be able to fully
  document them in this blog.
